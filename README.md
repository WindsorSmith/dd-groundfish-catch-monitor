# Groundfish Catch Monitor
This repository holds all the code, data, and related files for my solution to the "N+1 fish, N+2 fish" competition hosted by DrivenData (see https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/48/identify-fish-challenge/), which will serve as my capstone project for the machine learning course I've enrolled in -- Springboard's Machine Learning Engineering Career Track.
